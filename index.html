            <h2>About Me</h2>
        
                <p>Hello! I'm Adam Alvarez, a Data Scientist and Project Manager in Raleigh, NC. With a background spanning data analytics, digital marketing, and software project management, I'm passionate about using data to navigate our complex world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My education includes an undergraduate degree in Business Management from University of Virginia's McIntire School of Commerce, 
                    and a Data Science degree from BloomTech. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Excel (including VBA), and various machine 
                    learning frameworks. My professional values are built on a framework of integrity, hard work, and effective collaboration. 
                    I embrace challenges, uphold honesty, and value diverse perspectives to 
                    foster innovation and achieve shared goals.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, wine, travel, and adventuring outdoors with my wife, daughter, and dog. My goal is to become a domain expert in data science, helping companies thrive in a data-driven economy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Whether you're interested in collaboration or just connecting, I'd love to hear from you. Let's explore how we can use data to make sense of the world together!</p>
